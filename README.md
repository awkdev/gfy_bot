=======

A ruby based bot built upon the Snoo wrapper and powered by Azure cloud. It crawls through link posts, self posts and comments on *one or more given subs* at *set intervals* and looks for GIF images. These images are then uploaded to gfycat.com and the compressed gfycat link is posted as a comment in reply to the original post/comment.  Here's an example:
